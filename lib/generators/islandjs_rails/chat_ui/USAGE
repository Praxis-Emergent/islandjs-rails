Description:
    Generates a streaming chat UI with React islands for RubyLLM.
    Adds Turbo Streams support to enable real-time updates without page reloads.

Example:
    rails generate islandjs_rails:chat_ui

    This will create:
        Components:
            app/javascript/islands/components/ChatMessage.jsx
            app/javascript/islands/components/StreamingContent.jsx
            app/javascript/islands/components/ChatContainer.jsx
        
        Models:
            app/models/concerns/island_streaming.rb
        
        Helpers:
            app/helpers/chat_islands_helper.rb
        
        Stylesheets:
            app/assets/stylesheets/chat_islands.css
        
        Views:
            app/views/messages/_message_island.html.erb

    It will also:
        - Enhance your Message model with IslandStreaming
        - Add Turbo Stream island actions to your layout
        - Install React if not already present

Prerequisites:
    - RubyLLM must be installed: gem 'ruby_llm'
    - Run `rails generate ruby_llm:install` first
    - Run `rails generate ruby_llm:chat_ui` to create base models

Usage:
    After running the generator:
    
    1. Start yarn in watch mode:
       $ yarn watch
    
    2. Use the island partial in your views:
       <%= render 'messages/message_island', message: @message %>
    
    3. Or use the helper:
       <%= render_message_island(@message) %>
    
    4. Your messages will now stream with smooth animations!

    ✨ Character-by-character streaming animation
    ✨ Blinking cursor during streaming
    ✨ Progressive enhancement (HTML fallback)
    ✨ Tool call visualization
    ✨ Dark mode support
